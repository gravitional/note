## Tutorial --教程

### environment structure 环境的结构--待翻译总结

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{ <options> }
```

This command will process `<options>` using `\pgfkeys` with the default path set to `/tikzfeynman`.
Typically, `<options>` will be a comma-separated list of the form `<key>` = `<value>`,
Typically, this is used in the preamble of the document to add or change certain keys for the whole document.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram[ <TikZ options> ][ <diagram options> ]{ <diagram instructions> }
```

This commands creates a `{tikzpicture}` and `{feynman}` environment,and places a `\diagram` inside with the provided `<diagram instruction>`.
Please refer to the documentation for `\diagram` for the `<diagram instruction>` syntax.

结构如下：

```tikz
\begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{feynman}
            \diagram [vertical'=a to b] {
            i1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)]
            ...
            };
        \end{feynman}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

```tikz
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{feynman}
        \vertex (a) {\(\mu^{-}\)};
        ...
        \diagram* {
            (a) -- [fermion] (b) -- [fermion] (f1),
            ...
            };
    \end{feynman}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

The optional arguments specified in `<tikz options>` are passed on to the `{tikzpicture}`, and the `<diagram options>` are passed on to `\diagram`.
If only one optional argument is given, then the optional arguments are given to both.
A single optional argument will usually suffice as most keys are recognized by both commands;
however, in the event that a key is not recognized, both options are provided.

The `{feynman}` environment is where all the drawing of Feynman diagrams takes place. It makes all the `TikZ-Feynman` styles available and defines commands such as `\vertex` and `\diagram` which are otherwise unavailable outside of this environment.

```tikz
\vertex[<options>] (<name>) at (<coordinate>) {<contents>} ;
```

Defines a new vertex with the provided `<name>`. If `<contents>` is not provided the resulting vertex will have zero size.
On the other hand, if `<contents>` is provided, the `particle=<contents>` style is applied.
Additional styles can be applied to the vertex through `<options>`.
The final semicolon (`;`) is vital for this command since without it, the `LATEX` engine will not know when the `\vertex` command ends.
Additionally, this command cannot be chained like one can do with the in built `TikZ` commands.
This command is only available with the `{feynman}` environment.

```tikz
\diagram[<options>]{ <diagram instructions> }
```

```tikz
\diagram* [<options>]{<diagram instructions>}
```

Begins a newdiagram using the `spring layout`.
Keys passed through `<options>` can include general `TikZ` keys, graph-specific keys and any applicable `TikZ-Feynman` keys too. Other algorithms (such as `tree layout` ) can be passed through `<options>` and that will override the `spring layout` .
The syntax for the `<diagram instructions>` is thoroughly described in the `TikZ` manual, but in the context of this package, it will usually suffice to know the following:

+ Vertices within the graph are specified with no delimiters (i.e. no parenthesis, no brackets) and only require spaces around either side.
In order to refer to a vertex defined outside of the `\diagram` command, its name must be given in parenthesis: (`<name>`).
Note that in order to refer to external vertices, one must use `\diagram*`, as most algorithms (including the default `spring layout` ) are incompatible with vertices defined outside of the algorithm.
When a vertex name is used multiple times, the underlying algorithm will consider them to be the same vertex and introduces additional edges.
Options can be given to the vertex in brackets after the name: `<name>[<options>]` . For vertices defined outside of the `\diagram` command, these options should be specified when the vertex is first declared.
+ The edges between each pair of vertices is specified with `--` , and these can be chained together: `a -- b -- c`. In order to pass a style to the edge, it is specified in brackets after the dashed: `--[<options>]`. Forexample, to make on edge `red`, one woulduse `--[red]`.
+ A comma(`,`)—or equivalently a semicolon(`;`)—specifies the end of a sequence of edges and vertices and allows for another sequence to be started. So `a -- b`, `c -- d` will create two disconnected edges.
+ Subgroups (aking to `scopes` in `TikZ`) are specified with braces: `{[<options>]<diagram instructions>}`.
This can be quite useful when a lot of edges or nodes share a common style. Forexample,one could use `{[edges={fermion}] a -- b -- c, x -- y -- z}` and every edge will have the fermion style applied automatically.
Another useful feature of subgroups is that an edge to a group will create an edge to each vertex inthat subgroup as shown below. The example also shows how they can be nested which in some cases (such as with a `layered layout` ) can be extremely useful.

`\diagram*` is same as `\diagram`, but instead of using the `spring layout` algorithm to place the vertices, this uses the most basic algorithm. This basic algorithm in most cases will not produce a satisfactory diagram, but is intended to be used with vertices are declared and positioned outside of the `\diagram*` command.
Essentially, `\diagram*` should be used only to connect existing vertices.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, horizontal=a1 to b3] {
a1 -- {b1, b2, b3 -- {c1, c2 -- d1}}
};
```

### Loading the Package --载入包

After installing the package, the TikZ-Feynman package can be loaded with `\usepackage{tikz-feynman}` in the preamble.
It is recommend that you also specify the **version of TikZ-Feynman** to use with the optional package argument compat :
`\usepackage[compat=1.1.0]{tikz-feynman}`.
This ensures that any new versions of TikZ-Feynman do not produce any undesirable changes without warning.

### A First Diagram --第一个图

Feynman diagrams can be declared with the `\feynmandiagram` command.
It is analogous to the `\tikz` command from `TikZ` and requires a final semi-colon( `;` ) to finish the environment. For example, a simple s -channel diagram is:

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
i1 -- [fermion] a -- [fermion] i2,
a -- [photon] b,
f1 -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f2,
};
```

Let’s go through this example line by line:

+ Line 1 : `\feynmandiagram` introduces the Feynman diagram and allows for optiona larguments to be given in the brackets `[<options>]`. In this instance, `horizontal=a to b` orients the algorithm outputs such that the line through vertices `a` and `b` is horizontal.
+ Line 2 : The left fermion line is drawn by declaring three vertices ( `i1`, `a` and `i2` ) and connecting them with `edges`(边；边缘；边线；边沿) `--`. Just like the `\feynmandiagram` command above,each edge also take optional arguments specified in brackets `[<options>]`. In this instance, we want these edges to have arrows to indicate that they are fermion lines, so we add the fermion style to them.
As you will see later on, optional arguments can also be given to the vertices in exactly the same way.
+ Line 3 This edge connects vertices `a` and `b` with an edge styled as a photon. Since there is already a vertex labelled `a`, the algorithm will connect it to a new vertex labeled `b` .
+ Line 4 This line is analogous to line `2` and introduces two new vertices, `f1` and `f2`. It re-uses the previously labelled `b` vertex.
+ Line 5 Finish the declaration of the Feynman diagram. The final semi-colon (`;`) is important.

The name given to eac`<vertex>`n the graph does not matter.
So in this example, `i1`, `i2` denote the initial particles;
`f1`, `f2` denotes the final particles;
and `a`, `b` are the end points of the propagator.
The only importantaspectis that what we called `a` in `line 2` is also `a` in `line 3` so that the underlying algorithm treats them as the same vertex.
The order in which vertices are declared does not matter as the default algorithm re-arranges everything. For example,one might prefer to draw the fermion lines all at once, as with the following example (note also that the way we named vertices is completely different):

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=f2 to f3] {
f1 -- [fermion] f2 -- [fermion] f3 -- [fermion] f4,
f2 -- [photon] p1,
f3 -- [photon] p2,
};
```

As a final remark,the calculation of where vertices should be placed is usually done through an algorithm written in Lua. As a result, LuaTEX is required in order to make use of these algorithms. If LuaTEX is not used, TikZ-Feynman will default to a more rudimentary algorithm and will warn the user instead.

### Adding Styles --添加样式

So far, the examples have only used the photon and fermion styles.
The TikZ-Feynman package comes with quite a few extra styles for edges and vertices which are all documented over in section 3.
As an example, it is possible to add momentum arrows with `momentum=<text>`, and in the case of end vertices, the particle can be labelled with `particle=<text>`. As an example, we take the generic s-channel diagram from section 2.2 and make it a $e^+~e^−~\to~\mu^+ ~\mu^−$ diagram.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
i1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)] -- [fermion] a -- [fermion] i2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)],
a -- [photon, edge label=\(\gamma\), momentum'=\(k\)] b,
f1 [particle=\(\mu^{+}\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f2 [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)],
};
```

In addition to the style keys documented below, style keys from TikZ can be used as well:

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
i1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)] -- [fermion, very thick] a -- [fermion, opacity=0.2] i2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)],
a -- [red, photon, edge label=\(\gamma\), momentum'={[arrow style=red]\(k\)}] b,
f1 [particle=\(\mu^{+}\)] -- [fermion, opacity=0.2] b -- [fermion, very thick] f2 [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)],
};
```

For a list of all the various styles that TikZ provides, have a look at the TikZ manual; it is extremely thorough and provides many usage examples.
TikZ-Feynman also supports combining styles together which can be useful in certain new models such as super-symmetry:

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
i1 [particle=\(\tilde W\)] -- [plain, boson] a -- [anti fermion] i2 [particle=\(q\)],
a -- [charged scalar, edge label=\(\tilde q\)] b,
f1 [particle=\(\tilde g\)] -- [plain, gluon] b -- [fermion] [particle=\(q\)],
};
```

### When the Algorithm Isn’t Enough --若算法不豫

By default, the `\feynmandiagram` and `\diagram` commands use the `spring layout algorithm` to place all the
edges.
The `spring layout algorithm` attempts to ‘spread out’ the diagram as much as possible which—for most simpler diagrams—give sasatisfactory result;
however in some cases,this does not produce the best diagram and this section will look at alternatives.

There are three main alternatives:

+ Add invisible edges : While still using the default algorithm, it is possible to force certain vertices to bo closer together by adding extra edges and making them invisible through `draw=none` . The algorithm will treat these extra edges in the same way, but they are simply not drawn at the end;
+ Use a different algorithm In some circumstances, other algorithms may be better suited. Some of the other graph layout algorithms are listed in section 3.2.2 and an exhaustivel is t ofall algorithms and their parameters is given in the TikZ manual;
Manual placement As a last resort very complicated or unusual diagrams will require each vertex to be manually placed.

#### Invisible Edges --隐形连线

The underlying algorithm treats all edges in exactly the same way when calculating where to place all the vertices, and the actual drawing of the diagram (after the placements have been calculated) is done separately.
Consequently, it is possible to add edges to the algorithm, but prevent them from being drawn byadding `draw=none` to the edgestyle.

This is particularly useful if you want to ensure that the initial or final states remain closer together than they would have otherwise as illustrated in the following example (note that `opacity=0.2` is used instead of `draw=none` to illustrate where exactly the edge is located).

```tikz
% No invisible edge to keep the two photons together
\feynmandiagram [small, horizontal=a to t1] {
a [particle=\(\pi^{0}\)] -- [scalar] t1 -- t2 -- t3 -- t1,
t2 -- [photon] p1 [particle=\(\gamma\)],
t3 -- [photon] p2 [particle=\(\gamma\)],
};
```

```tikz
% Invisible edge ensures photons are parallel
\feynmandiagram [small, horizontal=a to t1] {
a [particle=\(\pi^{0}\)] -- [scalar] t1 -- t2 -- t3 -- t1,
t2 -- [photon] p1 [particle=\(\gamma\)],
t3 -- [photon] p2 [particle=\(\gamma\)],
p1 -- [opacity=0.2] p2,
};
```

#### Alternative Algorithms --其他的算法

Thegraph drawing library from TikZ has several different algorithms to position the vertices. By default, `\diagram` and `\feynmandiagram` use the `spring layout` algorithm to place the vertices.
The `spring layout` attempts to spread everything out as much as possible which,in most cases, gives a nice diagram; however, there are certain cases where this does not work.
A good example where the spring layout doesn’t work are decays where we have the decaying particle on the left and all the daughter particles on the right.

```tikz
% Using the default spring layout
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
a [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f1 [particle=\(\nu_{\mu}\)],
b -- [boson, edge label=\(W^{-}\)] c,
f2 [particle=\(\overline \nu_{e}\)] -- [fermion] c -- [fermion] f3 [particle=\(e^{-}\)],
};
```

```tikz
% Using the layered layout
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=a to b] {
a [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f1 [particle=\(\nu_{\mu}\)],
b -- [boson, edge label'=\(W^{-}\)] c,
c -- [anti fermion] f2 [particle=\(\overline \nu_{e}\)],
c -- [fermion] f3 [particle=\(e^{-}\)],
};
```

You may notice that in addition to adding the `layered layout` style to `\feynmandiagram`, we also changed the order in which we specify the vertices.
This is because the `layered layout` algorithm does pay attention to the order in which vertices are declared(unlike the default spring layout ); as a result, `c--f2`, `c--f3` has a different meaning to `f2--c--f3` .
In the former case, `f2` and `f3` are both on the layer below `c` as desired; whilst the latter case places `f2` on the layer above `c` (that, the same layer as where the $W^−$ originates).

**note:** 层状的；分层的

```tikz
% Using the layered layout f2--c--f3
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=a to b] {
a [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f1 [particle=\(\nu_{\mu}\)],
b -- [boson, edge label'=\(W^{-}\)] c,
f2 -- [anti fermion] c [particle=\(\overline \nu_{e}\)]--
[fermion] f3 [particle=\(e^{-}\)],
};
```

**note:** error with this

#### Manual Placement

In more complicated diagrams, it is quite likely that none of the algorithms work, no matter how many invisible edges are added. In such cases, the vertices have to be placed manually. TikZ-Feynman allows for vertices to be manually placed by using the `\vertex` command.

The `\vertex` command is available only within the `feynman` environment (which itself is only available inside a `tikzpicture` ). The `feynman` environment loads all the relevant styles from `TikZ-Feynman` and declares additional `TikZ-Feynman`-specific commands such as `\vertex` and `\diagram`.
This is inspired from `PGFPlots` and its use of the `axis` environment.

The `\vertex` command is very much analogous to the `\node` command from `TikZ`, with the notable exception that the vertex contents are optional; that is, you need not have `{<text>}` at the end.
In the case where `{}` is specified, the vertex automatically is given the particle style, and otherwise it is a usual (zero-sized) vertex.

To specify where the vertices go, it is possible to give explicit coordinates though it is probably easiest to use the `positioning` library from `TikZ` which allows vertices to be placed relative to existing vertices. By using relative placements, it is possible to easily tweak one part of the graph and everything will adjust accordingly —the alternative being to manually adjust the coordinates of every affected vertex.

Finally, once all the vertices have been specified, the `\diagram*` command is used to specify all the edges. This works in much the same way as `\diagram` (and also`\feynmandiagram` ), except that it uses an very basic algorithm to place
new nodes and allows existing(named) nodes to beincluded.
In order to refer to an existing node,the node must be given in parentheses.

This whole process of specifying the nodes and then drawing the edges between them is shown below for the muon decay:

```tikz
% mannuly decide the drawing process
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{feynman}
\vertex (a) {\(\mu^{-}\)};
\vertex [right=of a] (b);
\vertex [above right=of b] (f1) {\(\nu_{\mu}\)};
\vertex [below right=of b] (c);
\vertex [above right=of c] (f2) {\(\overline \nu_{e}\)};
\vertex [below right=of c] (f3) {\(e^{-}\)};
\diagram* {
(a) -- [fermion] (b) -- [fermion] (f1),
(b) -- [boson, edge label'=\(W^{-}\)] (c),
(c) -- [anti fermion] (f2),
(c) -- [fermion] (f3),
};
\end{feynman}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

 $$ \vertex[positioning relative] \to \diagram*[edges] $$

```tikz
/tikz/edge label= <text> (no default)
/tikz/edge label'= <text> (no default)
```

Placesa label halfwayalong the edge with the giventext. The primed key switches which side of the edge thelabel is placed.

## Documentation

### Commands & Environments

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{ <options> }
```

This command will process `<options>` using `\pgfkeys` with the default path set to `/tikzfeynman`.
Typically, `<options>` will be a comma-separated list of the form `<key>` = `<value>`,though the full power of the mechanism behind `\pgfkeys` can be used (see the TikZ manual for a complete description).
Typically, this is used in the preamble of the document to add or change certain keys for the whole document.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram[ <TikZ options> ][ <diagram options> ]{ <diagram instructions> }
```

This commands creates a `{tikzpicture}` and `{feynman}` environment,and places a `\diagram` inside with the provided `<diagram instruction>`.
Please refer to the documentation for `\diagram` for the `<diagram instruction>` syntax.

The optional arguments specified in `<tikz options>` are passed on to the `{tikzpicture}`, and the `<diagram options>` are passed on to `\diagram`. If only one optional argument is given, then the optional arguments are given to both. A single optional argument will usually suffice as most keys are recognized by both commands;
however, in the event that a key is not recognized, both options are provided.

**note:** suffice: 足够

```tikz
\begin{feynman}[<options>]
<environment contents>
\end{feynman}
```

The `{feynman}` environment is where all the drawing of Feynman diagrams takes place. It makes all the `TikZ-Feynman` styles available and defines commands such as `\vertex` and `\diagram` which are otherwise unavailable outside of this environment. The `{feynman}` environment is only accessible within the `{tikzpicture}` environment.
Options which are passed in `<options>` apply for the whole environment in the same way that the `{scope}` environment work in TikZ.

```tikz
\vertex[<options>] (<name>) at (<coordinate>) {<contents>} ;
```

Defines a new vertex with the provided `<name>`. If `<contents>` is not provided the resulting vertex will have zero size. On the other hand, if `<contents>` is provided, the `particle=<contents>` style is applied.
Additional styles can be applied to the vertex through `<options>`.
The final semicolon (`;`) is vital for this command since without it, the LATEX engine will not know when the `\vertex` command ends. Additionally, this command cannot be chained like one can do with the in built `TikZ` commands.
This command is only available with the `{feynman}` environment.

**note:** chain : 一连串

```tikz
\diagram[  <options> ]{ <diagram instructions> }
```

Begins a newdiagram using the spring layout. Keys passed through `<options>` can include general `TikZ` keys, graph-specific keys and any applicable `TikZ-Feynman` keys too. Other algorithms (such as `tree layout` ) can be passed through `<options>` and that will override the `spring layout` .
The syntax for the `<diagram instructions>` isthoroughly described in the `TikZ` manual,but in the context of this package, it will usually suffice to know the following:

+ Vertices within the graph are specified with no delimiters (i.e. no parenthesis, no brackets) and only require spaces around either side.
In order to refer to a vertex defined outside of the `\diagram` command, its name must be given in parenthesis: (`<name>`).
Note that in order to refer to external vertices, one must use `\diagram*` as most algorithms (including the default `spring layout` ) are incompatible with vertices defined outside of the algorithm.
When a vertex name is used multiple times, the underlying algorithm will consider them to be the same vertex and introduces additional edges.
Options can be given to the vertex in brackets after the name: `<name>[<options>]` . For vertices defined outside of the `\diagram` command, these options should be specified when the vertex is first declared.
+ The edges between each pair of vertices is specified with `--` , and these can be chained together: `a -- b -- c`. In order to pass a style to the edge, it is specified in brackets after the dashed: `--[<options>]`. Forexample, to make on edge `red`, one woulduse `--[red]`.
+ A comma(`,`)—or equivalently a semicolon(`;`)—specifies the end of a sequence of edges and vertices and allows for another sequence to be started. So `a -- b`, `c -- d` will create two disconnected edges.
+ Subgroups (aking to `scopes` in `TikZ`) are specified with braces: `{[<options>]<diagram instructions>}`.
This can be quite useful when a lot of edges or nodes share a common style. Forexample,one could use `{[edges={fermion}] a -- b -- c, x -- y -- z}` and every edge will have the fermion style applied automatically.
Another useful feature of subgroups is that an edge to a group will create an edge to each vertex inthat subgroup as shown below. The example also shows how they can be nested which in some cases (such as with a `layered layout` ) can be extremely useful.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, horizontal=a1 to b3] {
a1 -- {b1, b2, b3 -- {c1, c2 -- d1}}
};
```

```tikz
\diagram* [<options>]{<diagram instructions>}
```

Same as `\diagram`, but instead of using the `spring layout` algorithm to place the vertices, this uses the most basic algorithm. This basic algorithm in most cases will not produce a satisfactory diagram, but is intended to be used with vertices are declared and positioned outside of the `\diagram*` command.
Essentially, `\diagram*` should be used only to connect existing vertices.

### Keys & Styles

The various styles and options that allow the Feynman diagrams to be customized are defined in what `TikZ` calls `keys`. The documentation includes all keys which are defined within `TikZ-Feynman` which all begin with the prefix `/tikzfeynman`.
In addition,a few of the keys from `TikZ` itself which are particularly useful to `TikZ-Feynman` are documented and these are prefixed with `/tikz` or `/graph drawing`. Please refer to the `TikZ` manual for a more in thorough documentation of the `TikZ` keys.
`TikZ-Feynman` providesmany `every <key>` which allow every instance of `<key>` to be modified. For example, to make every diagram `red` except for `small` diagrams which should be `blue`, then one would add to the preamble :

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{
every diagram={red},
every small={blue},
}
```

If you are completely unhappy with a particular inbuilt style, you can define your own style with with `<key>/.style={...}` as shown in the following example:

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{
myblob/.style={
shape=circle,
draw=blue,
fill=red,
}
}
```

All the keys defined here are made available inside the `{feynman}` environment and inside `\feynmandiagram`; but if you wish to access them outside of this (say, in a regular `{tikzpicture}` environment), you will need to specify the full path with the leading `/tikzfeynman`.

#### 费曼图keys

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/execute at begin feynman={<TEX code>} (no default)
/tikzfeynman/execute at end feynman={ <TEX code>} (no default)
```

Allows for custom code to be executed at the start or end of each `{feynman}` environment.

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/every feynman= <styles> (no default)
```

Set of styles which are applied to every `{feynman}` environments (and consequently, every apply inside all `\feynmandiagram` too). The style also applies to regular `TikZ` commands used inside the `{feynman}` environment.

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{every feynman={red}}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0, 0.5) {This is not red};
\begin{feynman}
\node at (0, -0.5) {This is red};
\end{feynman}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/inline= <node> (style, no default)
```

A style used to displaya `Feynmandiagram` inline (typically in an equation), and aligning such that its vertical placement is at the node specified. The node specification must enclosed in parentheses.
For nodes which contain text (such as when the particle style is applied), it is possible to use the baseline of the text inside the node to line up with the baseline of the equation by using (`<node>.base`) as demonstrated in the following example.
Note that this key applies additional styles to make the diagram fit in an equation more nicely; ifyou do not wish to have these additional styles, use the baseline key.

```tikz
\begin{equation}
\feynmandiagram [inline=(d.base), horizontal=d to b] {
a -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] c,
b -- [boson] d [particle=\(\gamma\)],
};
= i g_{e} \gamma^{\mu}
\end{equation}
```

key:

```tikz
/tikz/baseline= <node> (no default)
```

Changes the vertical alignment of the Feynman diagram such that it diagram’s baseline is at the node specified.
This works in the same was as `inline=<node>`, but it does not apply any additional styles (notice how the following example is larger than the one above).

```tikz
\begin{equation}
\feynmandiagram [baseline=(d.base), horizontal=d to b] {
a -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] c,
b -- [boson] d [particle=\(\gamma\)],
};
= i g_{e} \gamma^{\mu}
\end{equation}
```

key:

```tikz
/graph drawing/horizontal= <node> to <node> (no default)
/graph drawing/horizontal'= <node> to <node> (no default)
/graph drawing/vertical= <node> to <node> (no default)
/graph drawing/vertical'= <node> to <node> (no default)
```

The underlying algorithm will arrange all the `nodes` relativeto each other, but beyond that it has no idea how the overall graph should be oriented. By using one of the above keys, the final output of the algorithm is oriented and/or mirrored such that the two nodes specified are on the same horizontal(or vertical) line.
The two nodes need not actually be connected by an edge for this to work.
The two `<node>` specifications should not be enclosed in parentheses, unlike the inline and baseline keys.
The `horizontal'` and `vertical'` keys work in the same was as horizontal and vertical, but with a flip.

**note:** flip around the `<node> to <node>` axis

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [inline=(b), horizontal=a to b, red] {
a -- b -- {c [particle=\(c\)], d [particle=\(d\)]}
};
\feynmandiagram [inline=(b), horizontal'=a to b, blue] {
a -- b -- {c [particle=\(c\)], d [particle=\(d\)]}
};
\feynmandiagram [inline=(b), vertical=a to b, green!40!black] {
a -- b -- {c [particle=\(c\)], d [particle=\(d\)]}
};
\feynmandiagram [inline=(b), vertical=b to a, black] {
a -- b -- {c [particle=\(c\)], d [particle=\(d\)]}
};
```

#### Diagram Keys

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/every diagram= <styles> (no default)
```

Set of styles which are applied to every diagram; that is, to everything inside the `\feynmandiagram`, `\diagram` and `\diagram*` commands but not the general `{feynman}` environment (see `section 3.2.1` for that).

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{every diagram={red}}
\feynmandiagram [small, horizontal=d to b] {
a -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] c,
b -- [boson] d,
};
```

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/small (no value)
/tikzfeynman/medium (no value)
/tikzfeynman/large (no value)
```

Changes the default separation betweenthe vertices and changes thesize of arrows,blobs, and other shapes to fit different context. The `small` size is best used with when the diagram is quite simple and doesn’t have too many annotations(such as momentum arrows and particle labels).
The `medium` size is the default and is usually large enough that even diagrams with many labels and momentum arrows donot become too cluttered.
Finally the `large` key is best for large illustrations as used on the title page of this document.

**note:** cluttered: 杂乱的；凌乱的；挤满的

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [baseline=(b), small, horizontal=d to b, red] {
a -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] c,
b -- [boson] d,
};
\feynmandiagram [baseline=(b), medium, horizontal=d to b, green!40!black] {
a -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] c,
b -- [boson] d,
};
\feynmandiagram [baseline=(b), large, horizontal=d to b, blue] {
a -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] c,
b -- [boson] d,
};
```

There are several algorithms which are available to place the vertices which are all provided within the graph drawing libraryfrom `TikZ`. Below are listed a few of these layouts which are more relevant for drawing Feynman diagrams. For a more complete description of how these algorithm work, please refer to the `TikZ` manual.
Please note that most graph drawing algorithms are implemented in Lua and thus require `LuaTEX` in order to work.If `LuaTEX` is not used, `TikZ-Feynman` will default to a more rudimentary algorithm and will warn the user instead.

**note:** rudimentary: 基础的；基本的

key:

```tikz
/graph drawing/spring layout= <string> (no default)
```

Uses Hu’s spring layout as implemented by Pohlmann. This models each edge as springs and attempts to spread everything out as much as possible. This is the default layout.

**note:** spring: 弹簧；发条

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, small, horizontal=c to d] {
{a, b} -- c -- d -- {e, f},
};
```

key:

```tikz
/graph drawing/spring electrical layout= <string> (no default)
```

Uses Hu’s spring electrical layout as implemented by Pohlmann. This models each edge as springs and gives each vertex a charge. This algorithm allows for the charge of a particular vertex to be adjusted using the electric charge key (the default is 1 ).

**note:** charge: (电池或带电物质的)充电量,电荷

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle,
small, horizontal=c to d,
spring electrical layout
] {
{a, b [electric charge=2]} -- c -- d -- {e, f [electric charge=0.1]},
};
```

key:

```tikz
/graph drawing/layered layout=  <string> (no default)
```

Uses the Sugiyama layout algorithm as implemented by Pohlmann in order to place the node.

When an edge is specified, the first vertex is always located on the layer above the second vertex. This creates a hierarchy of vertices which is particularly useful for decays.
Two vertices can be forced to be on the same layer with the /graph drawing/same layer key.

**note:** hierarchy: 等级制度(尤指社会或组织), 层次体系

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, small, horizontal=a to b, layered layout] {
a -- b -- {c, d -- {e, f}},
};
```

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, small, horizontal=a to b, layered layout] {
a -- b -- {c -- {c1, c2}, d -- {d1, d2}},
{[same layer] c1, d},
};
```

```tikz
/graph drawing/tree layout=  <string> (no default)
```

Uses the Reingold–Tilform algorithm in order to place the node.
This works in a similar way to the layered layout, but has quite a lot of additional options to handle missing children in the tree. Please refer to the TikZ manual for a thorough description of these additional features.
When an edge is specified, the first vertex is always located on the layer above the second vertex. This creates a hierarchy of vertices which is particularly useful for decays.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, small, horizontal=a to b, tree layout] {
a -- b -- {c, d -- {e, f}},
};
```

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [nodes=circle, small, horizontal=a to b, tree layout] {
a -- b -- {c -- {c1, c2}, d -- {d1, d2}},
};
```

```tikz
/tikz/graphs/edges= <options> (no default)
/tikz/graphs/nodes= <options> (no default)
```

Just like it is possible to change the shape of every vertex or edge in the whole document, it is also possible to change the shape of every vertex or edge in a single diagram by modifying these keys and adding the desired styles.

#### 顶点 Keys

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/vertex (no value)
```

The default, base style applied to every vertex initially. Other styles are subsequently added. This sets the vertex shape to be a coordinate , that is, a null shape with no size or width.

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/every <vertex shape> = hstylesi (no default)
```

The style of specific vertices can be modified by changing the appropriate every `<vertex shape>` key. For example, in order to change the style of every `dot`-styled vertex, you can modify the every `dot` key, or to modify every `vertex` globally, the `every vertex` key can be modified.

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{
every vertex={red, dot},
every particle={blue},
every blob={draw=green!40!black, pattern color=green!40!black},
}
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
a [particle={\(\gamma, Z\)}] -- [boson] b [blob],
c -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] d,
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/dot (no value)
```

Modifies the vertex so that it has a small filled circle.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [small] {
a -- b [dot] -- {c, d}
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/square dot (no value)
```

Modifies the vertex so that it has a small filled square.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [small] {
a -- b [square dot] -- {c, d}
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/empty dot (no value)
```

Modifies the vertex so that it has a small empty circle.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [small] {
a -- b [empty dot] -- {c, d}
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/crossed dot (no value)
```

Modifies the vertex so that it has a small circle with a cross inside.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [small] {
a -- b [crossed dot] -- {c, d}
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/blob (no value)
```

Modifies the vertex so that it is a large blob, usually used to denote an effective operator.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [small] {
a -- b [blob] -- {c, d}
};
```

#### 连线 Keys

Just like with the various vertex keys, each edge type has a corresponding every `<edge type>` ; however, due to the existence of very similar keys such as `scalar`, `charged scalar` and `anti charged scalar`, more specific keys
inherit styles from less specific ones. For example, styles in every `scalar` will apply to `charged scalar` an `anti charged scalar`.

The edge styles do not over ride each other and instead stack. This means that an edge styled with both `boson` and `fermion` will consist of a straight line with a wavy line on top and an error. If not styles are provided, then a simple solid line is drawn.

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/every edge= <styles> (no default)
```

A style to apply to every edge initially.

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/every <edge style> = <styles> (style, no default)
```

The style of specific edges can be modified by changing the appropriate every `<edge style>` key. For example,
in order to make a global change to every boson , you can modify the every `boson` key.

```tikz
\tikzfeynmanset{
every edge={green},
every boson={red},
every photon={blue},
}
\feynmandiagram [small] {
a [particle=\(a\)] -- [boson] o -- [photon] b [particle=\(b\)],
f1 [particle=\(c\)] -- [fermion] o -- [scalar] f2 [particle=\(d\)],
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/plain (no value)
```

Draws a simple solid line. This style is identical to the default style applied if no other style is used, but is
provided so that it can be combined with other styles.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [plain] b};
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [plain, gluon] b};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/boson (no value)

```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/charged boson (no value)
```

Draws a sinusoidal line with an arrow to denote a charged boson.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [charged boson] b};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/anti charged boson (no value)
```

Draws a sinusoidal line with an arrow pointing the other way to to denote a anti charged boson.

/tikzfeynman/anti charged scalar (no value)
```

Draws a dashed line with an arrow pointing the other way to denote a charged scalar antiparticle.

\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [anti charged scalar] b};

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/ghost (no value)
```

Draws a dotted line to denote a ghost.

\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [ghost] b};

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/fermion (no value)
```

```

Draws a solid line with an arrow pointing the other way to denote an antifermion.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [anti fermion] b};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/majorana (no value)
```

Draws a solid line with two arrows pointing to the center to denote an Majorana particle.

```tikz

```

key:

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/gluon (no value)
```

Draws a coiled line to denote a gluon.

\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [gluon] b};

key:

```tikz
/tikz/edge label=  <text> (no default)
```

```tikz
/tikz/edge label'=  <text> (no default)
```

Placesa label halfwayalong the edge with the giventext. The primed keyswitches whichside of the edge the
label is placed.

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/insertion=[ <options> ]  <distance> (no default)
```

Places an insertion (for `mass` or `momentum` insertion) along an edge.
The distance specifies how far along the edge the insertion should be placed such that `0` and `1` respectively correspond to the start and the end of the edge.

Multiple insertions can be placed along a single edge by repeating the style key.
Through the `<options>` argument, the insertion size and style can be changed.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [insertion=0.33, insertion=0.67] b};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/insertion/size= <distance> (no default, initially 3pt )
```

Specifies how big the insertion should be. The length of each edge starting from the center will be $\sqrt{2} \times \left< distance \right>$.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [insertion={[size=10pt]0.4}] b};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/insertion/style=  <distance> (no default, initially empty)
```

Specifies additional styles to applying to the lines of the insertion.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {a -- [insertion={[style=red]0.4}] b};
```

#### 动量 Keys

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/momentum=[ <options> ] <text> (no default)
/tikzfeynman/momentum'=[ <options> ] <text> (no default)
/tikzfeynman/reversed momentum=[ <options> ] <text> (no default)
/tikzfeynman/reversed momentum'=[ <options> ] <text> (no default)
/tikzfeynman/rmomentum=[ <options> ] <text> (no default)
/tikzfeynman/rmomentum'=[ <options> ] <text> (no default)
```

Places a momentum arrow on the specified edge with label given by `<text>`. The primed(') version place the momentum arrow on the other side of the edge; that is, if the momentum arrow was on the right, it will be placed on the left of the edge. The reversed momentum and reversed momentum' keys are analogous to momentum and momentum' except that the momentum arrow points in the opposite direction.
Finally, the rmomentum and rmomentum' are aliases of reversed momentum and reversed momentum' .
Note that due to the way the arrow is drawn, it doesn’t inherit styles of the edge. As a result,they have to be re-specified through `<options>`.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=a to b] {
a -- [red, fermion, edge label'=\(ab\), momentum={[arrow style=red]\(p_{ab}\)}] b
-- [blue, photon, edge label'=\(bc\)] c
-- [green!40!black, scalar, momentum=\(p_{cd}\)] d,
};
```

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=b to c] {
a -- [photon, momentum=\(p\)] b
-- [fermion, half left, looseness=1.5, momentum=\(k\)] c
-- [fermion, half left, looseness=1.5, momentum=\(k-p\)] b,
c -- [photon, momentum=\(p\)] d,
};
```

The `<options>` allows for the following options to customize the appearance of the momentum arrows. These can be either set globally with the usual `\tikzfeynmanset` , or can be set on a individual basis through the `<options>` argument of the momentum key. In the latter case, only the `<key>` in `/tikzfeynman/momentum/<key>` is required.

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/momentum/label distance= <distance> (no default, initially 0pt )
```

Set the separation between the text and the arrow. Note that the text is still surrounded by an inner `sep=0.3333em` by default so the default distance of `0pt` will not result in the momentum label touching the arrow.

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/momentum/arrow distance= <distance> (no default, initially 3mm )
```

Set the separation between the edge and the arrow.

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/momentum/arrow shorten= <distance> (no default, initially 0.15 )
```

Specify the fraction of the total edge length by which the momentum arrow is shortened at each end.

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/momentum/label style= <style> (no default, initially empty)
```

Define styles to apply to the momentum label node.

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/momentum/arrow style= <style> (no default, initially empty)
```

Define style to apply to the momentum arrow.

#### 修饰 Keys

Modifier keys serve only to slightly modify a small feature of the edge.

key:

```tikz
/tikzfeynman/half left (no value)
/tikzfeynman/half right (no value)
/tikzfeynman/quarter left (no value)
/tikzfeynman/quarter right (no value)
```

Modifies the edge so that it bends left or right in such a way that it completes half a circle, or a quarter of a circle.

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
a -- [red, fermion, half left] b -- [blue, fermion, half left] a,
};
```

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to c] {
a -- [red!0!blue, fermion, quarter left] b
-- [red!33!blue, fermion, quarter left] c
-- [red!66!blue, fermion, quarter left] d
-- [red!100!blue, fermion, quarter left] a,
};
```

key:

```tikz
/tikz/out= <angle> (no default)
/tikz/in= <angle> (no default)
```

Specifies the angle at which the edge leaves the first vertex in an edge and the angle at which it enters the second vertex in an edge.

key:

```tikz
/tikz/relative= <true or false> (default true )
```

If relative is set to false , the angle is relative to the paper whilst when relative is set to true , the angle is relative to the straight line joining the two vertices.

key:

```tikz
/tikz/looseness= <number> (no default,initially 1)
```

As the name suggests, this specifies how ‘loose’ or ‘tight’ a curve is connecting two vertices.

## Examples-tikz

Below are a few diagrams which demonstrate how the package can be used in some more practical examples.

### Vertex Rule

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
a [particle=\(Z\)] -- [photon, momentum=\(p_{1}\)] b,
f1 [particle=\(\overline f\)]
-- [fermion, rmomentum'=\(p_{3}\)] b
-- [fermion, momentum=\(p_{2}\)] f2 [particle=\(f\)],
}
```

### Tree Level Diagrams

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [horizontal=a to b] {
i1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)] -- [fermion] a -- [fermion] i2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)],
a -- [photon, edge label=\(\gamma\)] b,
f1 [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f2 [particle=\(\mu^{+}\)],
};
```

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [vertical'=a to b] {
i1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)]
-- [fermion] a
-- [fermion] f1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)],
a -- [photon, edge label=\(\gamma\)] b,
i2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)]
-- [anti fermion] b
-- [anti fermion] f2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)],
};
```

```tikz
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{feynman}
\diagram [vertical'=a to b] {
i1 [particle=\(e^{-}\)]
-- [fermion] a
-- [draw=none] f1 [particle=\(e^{+}\)],
a -- [photon, edge label'=\(p\)] b,
i2 [particle=\(e^{+}\)]
-- [anti fermion] b
-- [draw=none] f2 [particle=\(e^{-}\)],
};
\diagram* {
(a) -- [fermion] (f2),
(b) -- [anti fermion] (f1),
};
\end{feynman}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

`note: \diagram* [<options>]{<diagram instructions>}`

Same as `\diagram`, but instead of using the `spring layout` algorithm to place the vertices, this uses the most basic algorithm. This basic algorithm in most cases will not produce a satisfactory diagram, but is intended to be used with vertices are declared and positioned outside of the `\diagram*` command.
Essentially, `\diagram*` should be used only to connect existing vertices.

### Loops

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=b to c] {
a -- [photon, momentum=\(p\)] b
-- [fermion, half left, momentum=\(k\)] c
-- [fermion, half left, momentum=\(k-p\)] b,
c -- [photon, momentum=\(p\)] d,
};
```

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=a to b] [edges=gluon] {
{i1, i2} -- a -- [half left] b -- [half left] a,
b -- {f1, f2},
};
```

### Box Diagrams

```tikz
\feynmandiagram [layered layout, horizontal=a to b] {
% Draw the top and bottom lines
i1 [particle=\(d\)]
-- [fermion] a
-- [photon, edge label=\(W^{-}\)] b
-- [fermion] f1 [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)],
i2 [particle=\(\overline s\)]
-- [anti fermion] c
-- [photon, edge label'=\(W^{+}\)] d
-- [anti fermion] f2 [particle=\(\mu^{+}\)],
% Draw the two internal fermion lines
{ [same layer] a -- [fermion, edge label'=\(q\)] c },
{ [same layer] b -- [anti fermion, edge label=\(\nu_{\mu}\)] d},
};
```
